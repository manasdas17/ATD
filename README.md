LMU-ATD (Adaptive Threshold Detector)
=======

An efficient real-time software implementation of a CA-CFAR built to run on any microprocessor that supports C.

Also included in this repository are MATLAB scripts to interface an Arduino running the software as well as the necessary Arduino code (written to run on a Arduino MEGA 2560).
